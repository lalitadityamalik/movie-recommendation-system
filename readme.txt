A Basic Machine Learning project.
Recommends movie using content-based recommedation.
Once you have all the files in the same directory, 
use the line 'streamlit run app.py' in the terminal
to make the model work.
I was obstructed twice while making the project:
i) my tmdb api-key stopped working.
ii) A pkl file was too large to be uploaded.
Here are the work arounds that I settled for:
i) I removed the movie-covers from the frontend, and hence, no longer needed the api-key.
ii) I uploaded the pkl file and added a link to it using  a .txt file in the repository.
